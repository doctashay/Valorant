# Valorant
Valorant is a project created in 2014 to serve as an outlet for learning C++. This project was managed locally on my machine and updated regularly with new features prior to game engine changes. 

In its' current state, this is a barebones version of the project with outdated features stripped away. 

The project builds as a DLL file that can be injected into DayZ.exe. The DLL is only intended for version 0.61 of the game, making it outdated by 3 years. It has not been maintained or cleaned up since 2017.

I am posting it in the hopes someone is able to benefit from it in some way. I do not plan to update this project at any point.

You will need the DirectX SDK (June 2010) to build the project in Visual Studio.
